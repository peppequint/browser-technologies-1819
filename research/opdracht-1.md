## Intro

## Colour

Colour is one of the most important features on the web. It can make or break a website, doesn't matter what kind of user you are trying to reach.
However, colour is also one of the most difficult features of the web; look at the example below.

People with vision problems does have a lot of trouble if a website doesn't have a good colour scheme.
But what happens if you only have a greyscale on a website? If the colours are turned off? How does it function?

### Examples

For Google Maps colours are very important. The whole map is based on standard colours to highlight different parts. When you 'turn off' the colours and everything is based on a greyscale, the map becomes totally different.
